## Project 1 - Jordan Lobasso https://lazer6769.github.io/Cart-253/Topics/art_jam/Art_Jam_Final/ 

- Jordan’s project took a very different approach to the assignment. Instead of creating a self-portrait, he let the user design their own. He was able to do this with multiple sliders that controlled the colour of each facial feature, as well as a draw tool. This project was really enjoyable to mess with, as there was just so much to do. It wasn’t a simple drawing with one movable object, but an entire experience. I spent a lot of time messing with the sliders and drawing silly hats on my character. I think giving the user the ability to draw significantly adds to the project, as it provides them with unlimited design options. Looking at the code, it was very organized and easy to understand. I went from not understanding how he did anything to quickly grasping the concept while reading through it. Overall, I think this is one of the most creative projects in the Art Jam. If I could make any suggestions, I would say to improve the UI a little more, adding titles to the sliders, and maybe spacing them out a little bit more. 

## Project 2 - Amanda Stormyr https://am-stormyr.github.io/cart253/topics/self-portrait/

- Amanda’s project is another great example of uniqueness. She incorporated both real-life images and sound effects into her project. There were multiple interactive features such as the eye following the cursor, and of course, this mini storyline with option buttons. I found myself playing it twice to see what would happen if I selected the other option (‘NO’) in this case. I really like how she made a “video game” out of a self-portrait assignment. There was a lot of creativity put into this project, and I’m glad I got to experience it myself. It was not only visually and audibly pleasing, but had great interactivity. Her code was also very organized with lots of comments making it easy to understand. Overall, this was a great project with lots of effort put into it. If I could make any suggestions, I would want to see a longer version of the game, but of course that's a lot to ask for a self-portrait assignment. (maybe next time!)

## Project 3 - Daniel Michurov https://cakeallen.github.io/cart253/art-jam/

- Daniel’s project features a full-page boss fight with his head as the boss. There’s a fully functional shooting system, with a boss bar, and hearts for yourself. The creativity on this project is insane. It’s extremely visually appealing and very fun to mess around with. There is so much interactivity on this page, from the eyes following you to the movable character that can shoot projectiles and take damage. In my opinion, this is probably the most visually appealing project in the art jam out of all the submissions. The code is a little more confusing than a lot of the others, mainly because of its length. I think Daniel did a wonderful job creating a project that is fun for the user to engage with and follows all the criteria of the jam with his self-portrait. Overall, an amazing project, and I don’t have any suggestions for it aside from organizing the code a little better.
