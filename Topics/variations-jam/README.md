## Description

> The project is a game about a frog which needs to eat flies to survive

> Start the Game by clicking on the frog, use arrow keys to control it, avoid the blue flies!

> Don't let the hunger bar run out or you'll lose, if you fill it fully, you win!

> Includes awesome music and sound effects

## Instructions Followed

> "A title and instructions screen." - Cool Title Animation and Transition

> "An ending." - If hunger bar gets too low, "Game Over" if it gets filled fully, "You Win"

> "A scoring system." - Hunger bar at top of screen

> "New kinds of fly movement." - Lane system, where the fly picks a random one to come down

> "New visual and/or audio effects." Lots of sound effects, background music, and some cool visuals with the title screen

> "Add at least two other features to the experience." Use arrow keys to move between lanes. Added bad fly (blue one) which harms the player. Hunger bar system.
