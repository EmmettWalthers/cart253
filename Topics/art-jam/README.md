## Description

> The project draws a hyper-realistic self portrait of myself

> The eyes follow the direction of the cursor 

> Clicking on the eye plays a sound effect as well as slowly turns it red the more you press it!

> This is a simulation of eye pain and not getting high...

> The eye slowly returns to white overtime

## Instructions Followed

> "Use variables to create change over time" - Eye changes back to white after being red.

> "Use mouseX and mouseY to allow for some user interaction" - Pupils of eye follow the cursor.

> "Use at least one p5 function youâ€™ve never tried" - I used both a sound playing function https://p5js.org/reference/p5.sound/ and the mouse being clicked, which at the time of making we had not done in class yet! https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mousePressed/

> "Use at least one conditional" - Checking if cursor was inside eye, turning it red and back to white.
