# Mod Jam Ideas

1. Have a fly somewhere on the title screen that when the frog eats it the game starts. (All player would need
to do is click the frog and it would automatically grab the fly, starting the game)

2. Title screen animation. (When the frog eats the fly something happens with the title like it breaks or gets
eaten with the fly)

3. Frog has belly that explodes. (Everytime the frog eats a fly, its sprite gets bigger until it eventually explodes)

4. Flies inside belly scoring system. (Instead of a number on screen you can see the flies in the belly of the frog)

5. Multiple flies at once. (Have a swarm of flies at once to make the game easier and faster paced)

6. Sound effect for everything. (The tongue moving, fly moving, eating, tongue grabbing, etc... should all have different sound effects)

7. Frog eyes track flies. (have the frogs eyes track the flies on screen)

8. Tongue goes to cursor. (Wherever the mouse is on the screen the tongue goes towards.)

9. Animated background. (Have the background go from day to night or something along those lines)

10. Have a "bad fly". (Something where if you eat it you lose a point, similar to the bomb in fruit ninja)

11. Time limit. (You only have a certain amount of time to eat all the flies or get a high score.)

12. Combo Points. (If you eat multiple flies in quick succession then you gain extra points)

13. Background music. (Cartoony, 8-bit, or dramatic music while you play)

14. Title music. (Different music track for the title track.)

15. Points meter. (Instead of points on screen, have a meter on the side that increase when you eat a fly and slowly decreases when you don't)

16. Points meter finale. (The points meter filling up all the way could be how the game ends)

17. Mini dialogue. (have the frog say something with text on screen everytime it eats a fly)

18. You play as the fly. (You control the fly trying to avoid the frog's tongue)

19. Heartbeat sound effect. (The longer you go without eating a fly you can hear a heartbeat getting louder)

20. Screen blur with meter. (Along with the sound effect if the meter starts to reach the bottom your screen gets darker or blurier until you lose the game)
