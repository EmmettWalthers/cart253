## Project 1 - Ray Hernaez https://rayhernaez.github.io/cart253/projects/mod-jam/index.html

- Ray’s game felt very unique. He did a great job at taking the base instructions and code and making a genuinely fun game out of it. The color-changing mechanic to kill certain bugs was a fun twist that engaged me more than a lot of the others. Instead of simply clicking one button or moving the frog side-to-side, you had to mix aiming, shooting, and changing your “weapon” all at the same time. This created a sense of urgency and stress (in a good way). However, I found the color changing a little confusing as the key binds were somewhat scattered, being based on the starting letter of each element (E, W, F, A). I think it would’ve been easier to grasp if it were numbers 1-4 or something similar. I would’ve also liked it if there were sound effects, as, although the game was fun, sitting in silence wasn’t so much. Overall, a great project, and with some simple tweaks and updates, it could be a great-finished product.

## Project 2 - Kai Maquivar Lavers https://kaim-bit.github.io/cart253/topics/Mod-Jam/frogfrogfrog

- Kai’s game was very interesting, to say the least. The starting menu consisted of two squares flying around the window, and to start the game or access the instructions, you have to hover over them. This is definitely unique and creative, but not very practical. The actual game itself was quite fun. Shooting the cannon, having to hit the moving flies which flew at different speeds, was quite engaging. I played through a couple of times, really trying to beat my last score. The power-ups or (pills) were a very interesting concept, but I was a little bit confused at first. A simple fix to this would be a little more instruction or some better textures instead of just circles. I’m not really sure how the shop system works, as it all happened so fast, but I understand the gist of it all. Again, a good concept, but it needs a little work. The sound effects added a nice touch, which definitely helped engage me. Overall, a solid project that needs a little graphical work but has super fun gameplay at heart.

## Project 3 - Lanna Check https://lannacheck-ops.github.io/cart253/mod-jam/frogfrogfrog/

- Lanna’s game was amazingly designed. Starting with the rules page, it was very clear and had this super cool interactivity to it. Instead of just reading through a list of rules, there were examples that you had to click on, which showed you exactly what they did. It was also very visually & audibly appealing. The flies, frog, and health bar all had nice designs, complemented by tons of sound effects. When it comes to the gameplay, it was super fun. Having 3 different types of flies made it very engaging, as you had to pay attention and couldn’t just click around randomly. There was also the potion feature, which was a nice little add-on. This was definitely my favorite game I played, as it was just so perfectly crafted. The gameplay, visuals, and SFX all felt like a real game. I wouldn’t be surprised if a game like this could’ve been the new Flappy Bird back in the day. Overall, really well done, and I’m excited to see more from Lanna during the variation jam.
